# Milestone 4

Used the simple solution of streaming the JSONObject as Maps of key values as String and Object.
  - Tried to create a class as JSON Nodes with key value, and path attributes, but ended up with the simple solution for easier testing.
  - Focused on getting the top level elements rather than looking at nested objects.
  - The goal is to help developers in going through JSONObject data through streams and its methods.
